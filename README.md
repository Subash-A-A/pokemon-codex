## Resources and Learning
I watched a bunch of youtube videos from channels like [Web dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFbNIlppjAuEX4znoulh0Cw) and [React Documentations](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) to make this app.  
I've learnt about different React hooks, axios and much more while making this app.
